<B><h2>BurpSuite Walkthrough</b></h2>
<br>
Burp Suite walkthrough typically refers to a step-by-step guide on how to use Burp Suite, a popular tool for web application security testing. The walkthrough usually covers the basics, such as setting up Burp Suite, configuring it with a browser, and performing various security tests, like intercepting traffic, scanning for vulnerabilities, and exploiting them.

<b><h2>Setting Up Burp Suite</b></h2>

⚪Download and Install: Install Burp Suite from the official PortSwigger website.
<br>
⚪Launch Burp Suite: Open Burp Suite, and you'll be greeted by the main dashboard.
<br>
⚪Configure the Browser: Set up your browser to use Burp as a proxy. 
<br>
⚪This usually involves setting the proxy settings in your browser to point to 127.0.0.1:8080.

<b><h2>Dashboard</b></h2>

The first tab that should be open is the Dashboard tab, but keep in mind that you can drag these tabs around so the order of your tabs may not match mine. I recommend putting them in an order that fits your workflow.
